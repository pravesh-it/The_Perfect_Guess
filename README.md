# The_Perfect_Guess

## 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile!
Hello! I'm glad you're here. This profile showcases a few of my Python projects, with a focus on simple games, interactive scripts, and playful logic to learn and have fun with programming.

## 📂 Projects in this Repository
1. Number Guessing Game (main.py)
A classic Python game where the computer picks a random number between 1 and 100, and you have to guess it. You'll get hints if your guess is too high or too low, and it tracks the number of attempts you take to get it right.

2. Heaven & Hell Loop (hell_heaven_loop.py)
An interactive terminal-based game where you decide your "fate" by typing either Heaven or Hell:

If you choose Heaven, you break free from the loop and get a warm welcome.

If you choose Hell, you’re stuck in an infinite loop—be careful!

Any other input is flagged as invalid.

## 🚀 Getting Started
